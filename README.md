# KAFKA PROJECT
 A data ingestion procedure for live streaming and custom data importing using Aiven and Kafka service with Python as fetcher

 😙 : First usage of Fake data to create a fake customer samples.

 
 🤔 : THen obvously adding our own data so that we have a customized pizza simulator that
       will be added to the faker Baseprovider so that it handles the state

       
 😄 : Later we add to the main data file using JSON beautification

 
 🥰  : Later on we add to the main file that has the Kafka service with the Aiven platform ,where the service is enabled
